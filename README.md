### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rodrigo Pazos

Yeah, **RO**drigo **PA**zos, born **1998** => **ropa1998**.

I'm a software engineering student :nerd_face: :books: in my last year (:crossed_fingers:) at Universidad Austral and I'm currently working at MuleSoft as Associate Software Engineer.

In my profile you will probably find both personal projects and college projects. I tend to work in Java :coffee:, Python :snake: and Scala and I'm currently making my thesis on the state of the art of the autonomous checkout technology ðŸ›’. 

I'm usually reading about clean code, software design and productivity. If that's not the case then I'm probably watching an MCU movie.
